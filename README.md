## Purpose

VeriZK leverages zkML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning) to prove the absence of vulnerabilities in (closed-) source code, particularly focusing on smart contracts within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

## Project Description

Imagine you've poured countless hours into crafting the perfect smart contract, only to face the daunting task of proving its safety without revealing your confidential source code.

Enter VeriZK! With VeriZK, developers can now confidently showcase the integrity of their contracts without compromising their code's confidentiality. Through Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Machine Learning, VeriZK empowers you to demonstrate your contract's reliability while keeping your code private. Say goodbye to sleepless nights worrying about rug pulls or vulnerabilities â€“ VeriZK has got your back, ensuring your creations are as trustworthy as they are confidential.

## How it's Made

We built our project, VeriZK, using Sindri with the Noir proving system, combining AI and Web3 technologies for smart contract verification while preserving privacy. Sindri's streamlined tooling and scalability, integrated with Noir, allowed us to create a unique solution. Developers upload code privately, generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs), ensuring contract authenticity. This innovative use of zkML technology is at the heart of VeriZK's success.
